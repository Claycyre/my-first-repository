# 🌙 Night Scene Signup Form Project

## Overview
This project explores the creative use of **AI‑assisted design** and **CSS gradients** to build a visually immersive signup form. The form is set against a dynamic background that transitions from a **sunset scene** into a **night‑time setting**, complete with stars, a glowing moon, and subtle atmospheric effects.

AI tools were used to generate the initial imagery and assist with Git commits (after permission). Claude Haiku and GPT‑5 mini were tested, with Claude providing preferred responses. The sunset was AI‑generated as a base, then refined manually to achieve the desired shadowing and gradient polish. The night scene was built with layered CSS gradients and custom effects.

## ✨ Night Scene Description
Behind the HTML form, the background depicts a **tranquil night sky**:
- Scattered stars of varying sizes and opacities, arranged with radial gradients.
- Occasional shooting stars streaking across the sky for motion and depth.
- A softly glowing moon with crater shadows and rim lighting, positioned in the upper left.
- Faint dusting of smaller stars to simulate depth and atmosphere.

This creates a **calm, immersive environment** for users filling out the form, balancing functionality with aesthetic appeal.

## 🌅 Sunset → Night Transition
Before the night‑time setting, a **sunset gradient** was applied:
- Warm oranges and purples fading into deep blues.
- Shadows adjusted to emphasize rounded edges of the form.
- The transition was designed to feel natural, moving from day into night.

This progression highlights the **contrast between warmth and coolness**, guiding the user visually from one theme to another.
