AI tools used: Visual Studio Code built-in AI (Claude and GPT 5-Mini)
Functions used: Ask, and Agent.


This project was my first experience using the built-in AI tools in Visual Studio Code, and it was a fairly 
mind-blowing experience for me. Previously, I had strictly worked through the browser versions of Copilot
and ChatGPT, but I experimented with Claude here as well, and I will definitely be using Claude in the 
future. Beyond simply enabling and using the in-application AI suite, I activated the agent to help
me through parts of the git process. My prior experience with AI never really made me aware of its 
potential, but using these tools definitely broadens my perspective on AI.
